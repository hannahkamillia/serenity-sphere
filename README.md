## Project Title
Serenity Sphere

<br>

## Introduction
Improving and maintaining our mental well-being is an essential aspect of our daily existence. As the number of students or adults facing mental health issues grows more prevalent, substantial efforts have been taken to enhance the accessibility of such crucial resources. This notably extends to the digital realm, where developers and governments have been making these resources available online; enabling individuals to seek mental health assistance on the web. Whether through virtual sessions with therapists, counselling services, or readily accessible written materials, this approach offers a valuable outlet for those seeking support whilst removing the necessity to be physically present at a specific location.

## Objective
This project aims to ease the user's journey in finding help for their mental health. Thus, the 'SerenitySphere' web application seeks to provide users with the necessary resources such as to contact, enquire and ultimately locate available therapists around the area. With this, users can use SerenitySphere as their go-to web application to assist them in the important aspects of their mental health. More specifically, this project links with SDG 3.4, which states, "By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and **treatment and promote mental health and well-being."**

## Challenges During Development

- Working in a 6-member group evoked some challenges in regards to the communication and information transparency amongst members. This was apparent especially during task allocation and updating each other on our individual progress.

- Since it was all of the members’ first attempt coding with Laravel, learning its basic concepts, as well as using Git Repositories, a lot of hours were put into learning the ropes of it all. 

- Despite the convenience of ‘pulling’ and ‘pushing’ our source codes during development, it was difficult to sync our changes when multiple members were simultaneously working on the repository (from different devices). 

- Even when using a pre-downloaded framework as our foundation, there was still some difficulty at first when navigating around the different files and components used in the source code.
